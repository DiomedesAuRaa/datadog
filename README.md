# Datadog Monitoring with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform configurations for setting up Datadog integrations to monitor in the terraform-cloud-services directory.

# Exporting Datadog Dashboards
A Python script, datadog-dashboard-export.py, is included in the repository to export Datadog dashboards as JSON files. This is useful for backup or migration purposes.

# Monitoring with Argo
If you use Argo there is an argocd file that should help get you started.
